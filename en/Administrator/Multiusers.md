# Multi users

## Create a new account

If you want to use wallabag with several persons, you can create new accounts from the configuration page.

At the bottom of this page there is a form where you should input a user name and a password.

It is now possible to login to this account from the login page of wallabag.

No information are shared among the accounts.

## Remove an account

It is possible to remove your own account from the configuration page. You simply have to enter your password and to ask for the removal.

Be careful: when there is only one account, it is - of course - impossible to remove it.
