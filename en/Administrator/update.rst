Update wallabag
===============

Update an existing wallabag installation
----------------------------------------

In order to update your installation, download and unzip the archive
into your installation folder. For example on Ubuntu/Debian:

::

    wget http://wllbg.org/latest
    unzip latest
    rsync -ur wallabag-version-number/* /var/www/html/wallabag/ # could be another location such as /srv/html, /usr/share/nginx/html

After that, just access wallabag in your browser and follow the
instructions to finish the update.

You can verify at the bottom of the configuration page that youâ€™re
running the last version.

**If it fails**, just delete the ``install`` folder and clear the cache:

::

    cd /var/www/html/wallabag/
    rm -r cache/* install/

Clearing the cache is also possible in the configuration page, clicking
on the link ``Delete Cache``.
