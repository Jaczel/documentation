Current state
-------------

To manage the different versions of wallabag, we use Git.

There are multiple branches for the source code of wallabag web app:

-  ``master`` branch : this is the stable branch, downloaded by those
   who wish to install wallabag for their own use.
-  ``dev`` branch : before being added on ``master`` branch, all bug
   fixes and new features must go on that branch. This branch is not
   recommended for production use.
-  ``v2`` branch : this is the branch for a revamp of wallabag.
   A whole chapter is to be focused on it.
