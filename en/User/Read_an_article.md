# Read an article

To read an article is not the most complex thing in wallabag: you only have to click on the title of the article for it to be displayed.

## Back to where you quit reading your article

If you quit reading an article while you are only at half of it (for example), when you will open it again, wallabag will display it at the place you left the article.

This feature works only with web applications and not with smartphone applications.

## Possible actions in an article

These actions are possible through the icons displayed at the top of the page. We suppose that you are using the theme Baggy ([read the documentation about how to change theme](Configure_wallabag.md)). Icons in other themes are very similar.  

Here are the actions, in the order of appearance of the icons.

### Mark the article as favorite

Mark the article as favorite, and it will be put to the category **Favorites** of the wallabag menu
Clicking again on this button will remove the favorite status.
