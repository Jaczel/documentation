# Search content in wallabag

To enable you to find an article quickly, we set up a full search engine.

Click on **Search** in the wallabag menu. Then, enter your search terms.

Wallabag will go through all your articles, and lists the ones containing the search terms in their title or in their content.

## Convert this search into ePub format

You can convert the listed articles to the ePub format, so that you can read them in your e-reader, for example. Look at [ePub conversion](epub_conversion.md) for more about this.

## Assign a tag to your search results

You can create a tag based on your search criteria. Loot at [Organize articles](Organize_articles.md) for more about this.
