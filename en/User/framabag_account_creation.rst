Framabag account creation
=========================

If you do not want to install and update wallabag, or if you do not have
the know-how to install it, it is possible to create an account for free
at `Framabag.org <https://www.framabag.org>`__.

Account creation
----------------

Click on the button **Cr√©ez votre compte / Create your account**.

You have to input some information: your username, your password and
your email address. Your address is used only to validate your account,
except if you check the box to subscribe the newsletter (3 to 4 messages
per year).

Once this form validated, you will receive an email with the
confirmation link. Click on it to create your account.

You will receive a last email with the address of your Framabag account,
which will look like ``https://www.framabag.org/u/Your-username``.

Information storage
-------------------

Framabag use one database per user. We do not and will not use your
stored data.

You have forgotten your password
--------------------------------

| If you have forgotten your password to get connected to Framabag, a
form is available `on the main page of the
service <https://www.framabag.org>`__.
| Fill it, and a confirmation will be sent to you and will allow you to
input a new password.

----------------

If you wish to delete your account, contact us by email:
hello@wallabag.org using the address your created your account with, and
