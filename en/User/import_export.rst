Import and export data
======================

Import
------

To import data in wallabag, go to the page **Configuration**.

Caution
~~~~~~~

Data import can be a **demanding process** for your server. Hence, it is
done in two steps:

-  Insertion of the URL in the wallabag database
-  in the second step, the retrieval, for each article, of its full
   content.

These two steps cannot be done concurrently, because it let us the
possibility to import thousands of links, but today, wallabag does not
have sufficient technical capabilities to do this task automatically.

From Pocket
~~~~~~~~~~~

Export your data from Pocket
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From your Pocket account, go to the options. TODO

Import your Pocket data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From the configuration page of wallabag, section **Import**, select the
file ``ril_export.html`` generated by Pocket, then click on **Import**.
Wallabag only insert these links in the database. Now, you have to get
the content of each article.

For this, click on ``Click to finish import``: wallabag will fetch the
content of 10 articles at a time.

From wallabag
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since you can export your data from wallabag (see below), it is of
course possible to re-import them.

In the import form, select your wallabag-exported file (format JSON).
Start the import, et voil√†.

Unlike the above imports, this process is shorter because all the data
(title and content of the articles) are already included in the file.
Hence wallabag does not have to access each URL. However, the import
file is necessarily bigger.

From a HTML or JSON file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TODO

Export
------

It is possible to export your data from the page **Configuration** of
wallabag. Several reasons to do this:

-  re-install of wallabag
-  leave the Framabag service to install your own wallabag
-  a user with an account on a multi-user wallabag want to have his/her
   own wallabag installation
-  ...

This will lead you to download a file `at the JSON
format <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_Object_Notation>`__. As detailed above, you can import this file in wallabag.
