Organize articles
=================

To be able to find more easily your articles, several methods are
available.

Tags

Assign a tag
~~~~~~~~~~~~

When saving an article
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To tag an article when saving it, just click on the tag icon next to the
URL field before hitting the Save button. At the moment, it is possible
only to do this from the web interface, but it could come to some apps
or extensions.

From the article
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To tag an already-saved article, go to the reading page of the article.
There is a part ``tags`` followed with a pencil. Click on the pencil.

Input in the box the tags you want to assign. Add as many tags as you
want. They need to be separated by commas and not spaces.
Auto-completion is available here: when you type the first letters of an
existing tag, it is not necessary to type the whole word. Select it in
the drop-down list. Once all your tags are inputted, click on the button
**Tag**.

Then, you can go back to your article and read it.

From the search
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A full chapter on search is available. Here, we will describe only how
to assign a tag from your search.

When your search displays results, there is a link
``Apply the tag ABCD to this search`` at the bottom of the page. Click
on it: a tad depending on your search (here ``ABCD``) will be assigned
to all the articles found.

Find all the articles with a given tag
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the wallabag menu, click on **Tags**. Then, all the tags you have
created are displayed, sorted by the number of articles for each tag.
Click on one of these tags to find all the articles with this tag.

Preferred articles
------------------

When you wish to set aside an article, you can mark it as preferred.

Set an article as favorite
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the reading page of an article, or from a list of articles (such as
the list of unread articles), you can set an article as favorite simply
by a click on the star which is displayed. Click again on the star will
remove the **favorite** status of this article.

Find all the favorite articles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the wallabag menu, click on **Favorites** to display the list of all
the articles that you have set as favorite.

Archived articles
-----------------

When you have read an article, you can archive it: hence it will not be
displayed in your list of unread articles.

Archiving an article does not remove it from wallabag.

Archive an article
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| From the reading page of an article, or from a list of articles (such
as the list of unread articles), you can archive an article simply by
clicking on the icon âœ“.
| Click again on this icon will set back the **unread** status of the
article.

Find all the archived articles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the wallabag menu, click on **Archive** to find all the articles that
you have archived.

Delete an article
-----------------

Be cautious: the deletion of an article is **definitive**. It is deleted
from the wallabag database.

To delete an article, a trash icon is displayed on the page of an
article or of a list of articles (unread articles, favorites or
archived, for example).

We trust you: that is why there is no confirmation message during the
deletion.
