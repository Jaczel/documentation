Read an article
===============

Reading an article is not difficult in wallabag: you only have to click on the title of the article for it to be displayed.

Back to where you left the article
----------------------------------

If you stop reading an article halfway through, the next time wallabag will open it right where you left off.

This feature only works with web applications and not with smartphone applications.

Possible actions in an article
------------------------------

The following actions can be performed through the icons displayed at the top of the page. We assume here that you are using the Baggy theme (see the section on :ref:`Howto change theme`). Icons in other themes are very similar.
