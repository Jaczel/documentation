RSS feeds
=========

The RSS feeds allow you to:

-  read your articles from your favorite RSS feed reader.
-  to activate the reading features for smartphone softwares

| First, you must activate the RSS feature by generating a feed token.
| Go to **config** in wallabag and generate a token in the section
**Feeds**. You can generate a new token at any time.

Read articles
-------------

Once the token created, you have access to three RSS feeds:

-  the one of the unread articles
-  the one of the favorites articles
-  the one of the archived articles

Add the feed you want to your RSS feed reader. Be careful: when you will
be reading an article from your feed reader, this will not set it as
read in wallabag.

Share your readings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you wish to share your readings with somebody, send him for example
the RSS feed of your favorite articles. Hence, as soon as an article
will be set as favorite in wallabag, this person will be able to read it
too.

Activate the features for smartphones
-------------------------------------

You ave created an RSS feed token. It will also be useful to you to
configure your smartphone software. For more information about
smartphone sofwares, you can read :ref:`Save your first article`.
