Save your first article
=======================

The main purpose of wallabag is to save web articles. You have many ways to do it.

By using a bookmarklet
----------------------

On the ``Howto`` page, you have a ``Bookmarklet`` tab. Drag and drop the ``bag it!`` link to your bookmarks bar of your browser.

Now, each time you're reading an article on the web and you want to save it, click on the ``bag it!`` link in your bookmarks bar. The article is saved.

By using the classic form
-------------------------

In the top bar of your screen, you have 3 icons. With the first one, a plus sign, you can easily save a new article.

   :align: center

Click on it to display a new field, paste the article URL inside and press your ``Return`` key. The article is saved.

By using a browser add-on
-------------------------

Firefox
~~~~~~~

Firefox Classic Add-on
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Download the Firefox add-on at `addons.mozilla.org`_ and install it like
any other Firefox add-on.

In the add-on’s settings, fill the complete URL of your installation of
wallabag or your Framabag account.

Personalize the Firefox toolbar to add wallabag (**W** icon). When you
find an article you want to save, click on this icon: a new window will
open to add the article and will close itself automatically.

Firefox Social API Service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Available from wallabag v1.9.1 only*

You will need an https connection to use this. It’s a Firefox
`requirement`_, sorry.

With Firefox 29+ versions, your browser comes with an integrated
interface to share things to multiple social services directly from your
browser. In the Firefox interface, it is shown a paper plane-like icon
that you will use to share a page, which means here, save an article.
You can add the service by going into the Config page of wallabag, then
click on Mozilla Services Social API Extension. You must also accept to
use Firefox Services.
